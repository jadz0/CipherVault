# CipherVault
CipherVault is a Python-based command-line password vault that securely stores credentials using a master password. It derives strong encryption keys with PBKDF2 (SHA-256) and encrypts all data at rest using Fernet, ensuring confidentiality and integrity while providing simple CLI commands to manage entries.
